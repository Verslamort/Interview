Me Before You 3
"Morning, Mr.Traynor."The security guard steps out of his cubicle. lt's weather-proof, even though down here there is no
 weather to beprotected from. Will sometimes wonders what he doesdown here in the small hours, staring at the
 closed-circuittelevisionand the glossy bumpers of f60,000 cars thatnever get dirty.He shoulders his way into his
 leather jacket."What'sit like out there, Mick?""Terrible. Raining cats and dogs."Will stops."Really? Not weather
 for the bike?"Mick shakes his head."No, sir. Not unless you've gotan inflatable attachment. Or a death wish."Will
 stares at his bike, then peels himself out of hisleathers. No matter what Lissa thinks, he is not a manwho believes
 in taking unnecessary risks. He unlocks thetop box of his bike and places the leathers inside, lock-ing it and throwing
 the keys at Mick, who catches themneatly with one hand."Stick those throughmy door, willyou?""No problem. You want me
 to call a taxi for you?""No. No point both of us getting wet."Mick presses the button to open the automatic barrierand
 Will steps out, lifting a hand in thanks. The earlymorning is dark and thunderous around him, the CentralLondon traffic
 already dense and slow despite the fact thatit is barely half past seven. He pulls his collar up aroundhis neck and
 strides down the streettoward the junctionfrom where he is most likely to hail a taxi. The roads areslick with water,
 the gray light shining on the mirroredpavement.He curses inwardly as he spies the other suited peo-ple standing on the
 edgeof the curb. Since when did thewhole of London begin getting up so early? Everyonehas had the same idea.
 He is wondering where best to position himself whenhis phone rings. lt is Rupert.
